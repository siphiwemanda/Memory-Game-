* Notes by reviewer
Good job fixing the issues that were in your project as highlighted by the previous reviewer.
Just a minor issue remains with the star rating, however, you can easily fix it as you've done really well already.
Keep up the good work in your future projects and keep improving your skills.

Good job implementing a star rating that works.
Make sure you take note of project specifications as it said that the star rating system
should show from 1-3 meaning that it shouldn't get to 0 stars but have 1 star as the minimum.

According to the Udacity Nanodegree JavaScript Style Guide there isn't a good reason anymore for using var for variable declaration
so consider replacing var with let.

Consider using ES6 backticks for variable interpolation so that you don't have
to use + between your variables and string data.

Remove this last if statement on line 78 so that the star rating doesn't go below 1 stars and the minimum should be 1 star and maximum being 3 stars.
