# Memory Game Project

The Memory game is a project for the Udacity Front End NanoDegree

It is a simple card flipping game where the payer has to flip a card and try and match it to another card in the grid.
The player receives three stars for completing the game in less than 17 moves, the stars then decrease depending on how many moves it takes the player to finish the game.

When the game ends the player is informed of how long it took to complete the game, the star rating and the number of moves it took them to complete it.


A working example of the game can be found here: https://siphiwemanda.github.io/MemoryGame/


The game utilises the following
* Sweetalert https://sweetalert.js.org/guides/ for the alert function
* Animate css https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/ for the animation on css

The game requires the following files:
* index.html
* js/app.js
* css/app.css
* css/animate.css
* img/geometry2.png

# How to play
The game starts when you click the fist card.
The card will flip over and reveal the picture behind it.
Click on any other open card on the grid, it will flip over and reveal the picture behind it.
If the two cards match they will stay open.
Keep playing until you have matched all the cards!
